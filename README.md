# BoundlessAgro


Hydroponic farming is a technique by which plants are grown with the help of nutrients from water instead of soil. <br>
This project aims to develop a system to remotely and efficiently manage and monitor hydroponic farming, which is a good solution for the problem of scarce arable lands.<br>
It aims at implementing predictive maintenance, diagnostic analysis with the help of a dashboard and automating the conditions such as temperature, humidity, oxygen
to be pumped, etc.. while also enabling the user to manually control them.
